Challenge #321 [Hard] Circle Splitter

You've got a square in 2D space with axis values between 0-1 which is filled
with points. Can you place a circle within the square such that exactly half
of the points in the square lie within the circle?

    * Circle may touch the edge of the square but may not pass outside.
    * Points on the edge of the circle count as inside.
    * There will always be an even number of points.
    * You must indicate if it is unsolvable.
